The footage in this video is a short clip from a Spaghetti Western made in 1971 directed by Luigi Batzella. 
<br/>The American version of the film is called Paid in Blood. 
<br/>The film’s original Italian name is Quelle Sporche Anime Dannate 
<br/>which roughly translates to Those Damned, Dirty, Souls.
	<br/>
	<br/>
<br/>In translating this title, three words appeared which were of much interest to me, “damned”, “dirty”, and “soul”. 
<br/>In the Webster's 1828 dictionary the word damned is described synonymously with to condemn: 
<br/>to decide to be wrong or worthy of punishment; to censure; to reprobate.
<br/>He that doubteth is damned if he eat. Rom xiv 3. The full passage in Romans 14:23 reads: 
		<br/>
<br/>“ and he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.”
		<br/>
<br/>In this binary, what is not of faith must be of sin. What is not of faith is condemned. 
<br/>The word condemn can also mean to declare to be unfit for use or consumption. 
<br/>What is sin then must be unworthy of eating, of consuming, bringing into oneself, or onto one’s body. 
<br/>He that doubteth is entering into a place between the binary of faith and sin, 
<br/>He will not eat so as to be saved from being damned. 
<br/>He that doubteth is choosing neither faith nor sin. He enters into the unknown. 
<br/>The unknown place where He cannot consume the divine.Without the consumption of the divine He becomes secular. 
<br/>The divine is rejected by His body. The secular body is removed of His “soul”. 
<br/>The secular body who cannot eat (neither in faith nor in sin), becomes a condemned man. A damned man. 
	<br/>
	   <br/>
<br/>The dirtiness was apparent. 
<br/>There was a close connection to dirtiness in the making of the piece, and the context which it came out of.
<br/>The role of dirtiness, at this point in time, is the thing that facilitates one being damned. 
<br/>If one is found to be dirty He is, as in the definition of damned: to be wrong or worthy of punishment. 
<br/>Through mapping the relationship of these words, this became my way of experiencing the obsession with the death of the cowboy. 
<br/>
	   <br/>
<br/>Four years ago I met a man who had a fetish for getting shot: the word, the idea, the action.
<br/>He wanted to role play for hours on end, acting out complicated scenes of getting shot,
<br/>pretending to get shot at a sleepover,being an arrogant soldier going off to war who is indifferent 
<br/>to the fact that he may get shot, crying over his lover’s dead body who had been shot.
<br/>He was very particular about the way the world “shot” was said in these scenes. 
<br/>He wanted very specific emphasis put on it. He would correct the way it was said, 
<br/>and constantly direct in how the word was delivered. It had to be at the exact volume,
<br/>with the exact emphasis, the exact pause before and after, and the exact eye contact. 
<br/>He was specifically obsessed with cowboys, and images of young cowboys getting shot. 
<br/>He showed me a video on his phone of a young cowboy running and being shot in the back. 
<br/>He showed me on his phone the same video in a few different speeds, and I later noticed
<br/>that he had at least 50 different versions of the video saved on his phone, slowed down and sped up incrementally. 
<br/>I did not know his name, and our first and last encounter only lasted for about four hours 
<br/>and ended with me lying on the floor, and him crying over my dead body. 
<br/>
	   <br/>
<br/>“....The cowboys have nowhere to get to. They’re older and they don’t have to make it anywhere because where they are is all there is. 
<br/>Theirs is not the Old Testament-- no journey to take; nothing promised; no land to land in. For them, life and death are simultaneously equal and present. 
<br/>The simultaneity of the living who are already dead is filmed as sexy….They all die in a kind of orgasmic rush...
<br/>Once the orgasm is over we can just lie back, close our eyes, and relax, though we are neither liberated nor fulfilled…”
			<br/>
	   <br/>
<br/>The damned man who no longer has a “soul” moves into the realm of objecthood. 
<br/>He is there for my observation. There is a sexiness and a dirtiness to observing the damned man. 
<br/>He has become the object of my desire.In observing the damned man I cannot consume Him, 
<br/>for if I chose to, I would also resign to be eating in sin. Food that is described as sinful is always the food we long to eat the most. 
<br/>I cannot consume the damned man, and yet I desire to.There are moments when observing Him that I also want to be Him. 
<br/>There are moments I lust for Him. I wish to simultaneously be Him and be with Him.
<br/>He is forbidden to eat and I am forbidden to eat Him. 
		<br/>
	   <br/>
<br/>“..and he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.”
		<br/>
	   <br/>

<br/>Years later I am still thinking of the intricacies of his infatuation, and the image of the young cowboy. 
<br/>I started to do research online to see if I could find the same footage of the cowboy running. 
<br/>After hours of scrolling through footage of westerns I was unable to unearth the same video. 
<br/>However, in the process I found an account online of a man named Gary J who has a youtube account and blog, 
<br/>which he has been posting on since 2012.The youtube account has exactly 504 videos of compilations of films 
<br/>including only the parts in which the men get shot. The majority of the videos are compiled from westerns. 
<br/>On one of his videos I saw a link to his blog, which is called Shot, Strangled, Stabbed Guys, on which he posts frequently. 
<br/>Each post contains a collection of stills and a video of a different film. 
<br/>Scattered amongst the posts are short snuff erotica stories that his followers have written and submitted. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>I began thinking it may be possible the man behind the blog was the same man I’d met. 
<br/>Despite everything, I remember his nature being distinctly kind, and soft. 
<br/>This was echoed in different places around his blog. He would leave sweet messages for his followers, 
<br/>wishing them happy holidays, or posting a picture of a tired polar bear, saying he needed a break from editing videos. 
<br/>The footage I ended up choosing is from a video he posted in 2013, and I decided to use this in place of the original footage I was searching for. 
<br/>
	   <br/>
<br/>“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral-immoral from the scientific point of view."
<br/>
	   <br/>
<br/>"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions.
		<br/>His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed.”
